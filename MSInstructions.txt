Yo, whats up Zhi, here are my instructions for the microservice:

How it program runs: 
Basically the format of this program is that the user is going to press 'p'
to generate a plan for the day. What happens is that the user can pick up to 5
places to visit.

Example program: (user picked 5)
    Enter 'k' to enter new keywords to filter results
    Enter 'p' to generate a plan for the day!
    Enter 'x' to exit program
    User Input -- p

    You entered planning mode!
    Enter how places you would like to visit (MAX 5): 5

After this, the program will loop through the amount of places the user put and ask for a keyword
Example:
    Place 1...
    What are you feeling? (enter keyword): Asian

    Place 2...
    What are you feeling? (enter keyword): Coffee

    Place 3...
    What are you feeling? (enter keyword): Steak 

    Place 4...
    What are you feeling? (enter keyword): American

    Place 5...
    What are you feeling? (enter keyword): Dinner

This will result in the program creating a list of places inside of the planner folder
which will have 5 files numbered 1-5.txt respectively for each place the user puts. The format that the list
will output will be:

    Bill's Steak House Lounge~Clyde's Prime Rib Restaurant and Bar~Acropolis Steakhouse~Chan's Steakery~de Fuego Grille~Sayler's Old Country Kitchen~Original Roadhouse Grill~Applebee's Grill + Bar~Applebee's Grill + Bar~Applebee's Grill + Bar~Stanford's Clackamas~Master Philly Cheesesteak~Laurelhurst Market~Steakadelphia~Celebrities Parkway Grill~River Roadhouse~The Observatory~Bumpers Grill & Bar~Ranch Tavern~Matador East Portland~5

Some explanation to this: 
    - the separator for these restaurants is ~ 
    - the last item in this list will include a number, which will be the 
      amount of items you will be creating a list for 

How the Microservice works:
So, for this microservice you will parse the file string to separate the restaurant names as well as the number at the end of the text.
Based on the number at the end of the text, you will randomly create a list of 1-5 restaurants formatted like:

    1. Some restaurant 
    2. Some restaurant 
    3. Some restaurant 
    4. Some restaurant 
    5. Some restaurant 

Once formatted, you can rewrite the output into their respective files. My original idea for this is that you can create a loop
that parses each file and creates the random list individually one by one. 

Let me know if you have any questions!
