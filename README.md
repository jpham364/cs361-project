# Microservice for Zhi
+ Uses text file communication to signal microservice and main program to run off of each other
+ To programmatically REQUEST data from the microservice I made, the main program will write a character's name on a file called char.txt. Example: 
```
charFile = open("char.txt", "w")
        resultFile.write(str(character))
        resultFile.close()
```
My microservice continuously checks for the existence of a char.txt. Once the microservice sees that there is a char.txt inside of the directory. It will read the file and extract the character's name to use inside of the microservice. 
+ To programmatically RECEIVE data, after my microservice finishes the survey that the user completes. It will create a result.txt with the sum of the answers since the questions uses numbers to answer. The main program will recieve the microservice data by reading the newly created result.txt file. Example:
```
resultFile = open("result.txt", "r")
sum = resultFile.read()
```
Once the main program reads the text file, it can process the data in whatever way my partner wants in his program.
